/**
 * WebSocket Client Utilities
 * 
 * This file contains only client-side WebSocket connection utilities.
 * The WebSocket server is separate and should be deployed independently.

 * See ws-server/ directory for the standalone server implementation.

// This file is kept for backwards compatibility but contains no server code.
// All WebSocket client functionality is now handled directly in index.js.
// The standalone WebSocket server is in the ws-server/ directory.
